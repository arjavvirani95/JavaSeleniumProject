frames/iframe

Frames => sometimes developer build websites into multiple frame, if we wants to interact with this frames of element then we need to switch to that frame first and perform any action. This is called Frames

iFrame => Sometime developer used thrid party url webform and implemented into current web page that is called iframe! Why? Becouse developer does not want to write that code instead of use those already buildin web forms or any web page!

=>if wants to come back to default web page
driver.switchTo().defaultContent();

=>if selenium not able to find frame it will throw NoSuchFrameException

=>
driver.switchTo().frame(name/id)
driver.switchTo().frame(WebElement)
driver.switchTo().frame(index)
