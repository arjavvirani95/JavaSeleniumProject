Day-37
------

1) InvocationCount
*Why?
=>sometimes you know your application is broking somewhere if you run that flow many times, so here invocation feature we can use from TestNg. 

*How you will run?
=> we need to invoke that test using invocationCount
@Test(invocationCount=10)


2) XML - Parallel testing

=>thread count we can put into suite level. Recommended.

=>Always try to run test parallely anyways we can also run classes and methods as parallely!

step1) create test case
step2) create xml file to run the test
step3) pass browser name parameter from the xml to setup() method
step4 ) execute test case on chrome & edge ( serial execution)
step5 ) execute test case on chrome & edge ( parallel execution)
