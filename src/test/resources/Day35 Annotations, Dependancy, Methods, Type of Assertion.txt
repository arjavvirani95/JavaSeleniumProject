Dependecy methods(Advantage of TestNG which is not available in JUnit)
----------
*Why need?
=>If we want to execute some method only after excecution of another method!

*How work?
If Dependent Method which is depend on another Method, if that method failed than Dependet method will skip!


Assertions
----------
validations

Hard assertions
----
access though 'Assert' class
all methods are static
if hard assertion got failed then rest of the statement will not be executed.

Soft assertions
-----------
access through 'SoftAssert' object

SoftAssert sa=new SoftAssert();
sa.assertTrue()

if soft assertion got failed then rest of the statemetns still execute.
